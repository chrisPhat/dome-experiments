# Preparation:

The STL files were downloaded, simplified with MeshLab using the "Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation" filter and they then compressed with [Draco]. The file name indicates the number of faces and the compression level. Examples:

* ml10k_cl10: Decimated to 10,000 faces in MeshLab, then compressed with Compression Level 10 in Draco.
* ml50k_cl10: Decimated to 50,000 faces in MeshLab, then compressed with Compression Level 10 in Draco.
